# chess-boxing
A chess boxing game created in Unity for the Ludwig Jam 2023

This game uses stockfish, included as an application in the game files. This means that the game runs stockfish in the background, through a hidden window. I only set it up for Windows--as such I can only guarantee that it will work on Windows computers.

The play experience is pretty hit or miss--depending on the position, you might experience some bugs.

The game centers around Ludwig escaping the basement of the IRS in order to feed Coots.

There's tons of stuff that had to be scrapped that I didn't have time to clean up: theres a framework in place to make this more like a rogue-lite than what is going on right now.

If you're reading through the code, and are actually able to understand it, you're in a better place than I am right now.
